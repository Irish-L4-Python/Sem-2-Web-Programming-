                        and he gives them to his nephew, Roy, the pizzas that are peppered suddenly come to life and turn into monsters.</p>

Whether it is 8 slices of pepperoni everywhere and 2 olives on the lower half, or a 10 onion pizza cooked well done and cut in 4 slices, there is no telling what they will come up with. 
                        So, master the 4 stations and work up the ranks to be the best Pizza Chef around.</p>
