        <h5>Cooper</h5>
        <p>Every morning, Cooper cooks up the fluffiest pancakes for all the townsfolk of Maple Mountain. 
        Even though he was unexpectedly “hired” by Papa Louie, Cooper quickly fell in love with flipping flapjacks for a living. 
        After work, Cooper and his cat, Cookie, head home to Tastyville.</p>
