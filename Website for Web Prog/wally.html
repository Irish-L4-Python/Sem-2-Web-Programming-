        <h5>Wally</h5>
        <p>Wally is a 72 year old retired environmental scientist and fisherman who lives with his grandson, Mitch, in a Tastyville apartment.
        He's one of the oldest people in Tastyville, as well as kindhearted and sweet, something that earns him the title of “everybody's favorite grandpa”.
